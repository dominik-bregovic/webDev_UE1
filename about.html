			CV Cover Dominik Bregovic

			My name is Dominik Bregovic. I am 28 years old and am currently taking the degree course
			at the FH-Joanneum in Graz.
			My enthusiasm for programming began about 2 years ago. I began to familiarize myself with
			this area and read more and more about programs, encryption techniques, cryptography,
			Dapps and programming languages, it became clear that my knowledge in this area was not
			sufficient.
			<br/><br/>
			After the initial disillusionment I began to take things seriously, the enthusiasm grew and it
			was clear to me: "That's what I want to do in my future! ". So, I started to learn a
			programming language in my own studies and tried a small project. Writing my own app
			seemed easy at first. Freely according to the motto: "Everything runs on Java anyway, so
			download the JDK and after a few YouTube videos I probably will be able to do something.
			"After a month you are facing the fact that you are doing “something”, but the efficiency is
			not existent or very bad.”
			<br/><br/>
			That was the blow that brought me back to the ground. But now I realized that if you want
			to do something, you should do it the right way. From this point on, there was no turning
			back. After extensive research on courses of study that could offer what I was looking for, I
			came to the FH-Joanneum.
			After 8 months I was surprised how far you can get if you have someone that leads you in
			the right direction, although the fact that it surprised me how hard it can get sometimes. My
			current goal is improving my programming and social skills, in consideration to team and
			project handling, so that I will be able to work independent and efficient.
			This summer I would try to develop my first own app with that cross-platform technology Flutter. Because of that fact I
			would be glad to get to know you better.
			<br/><br/>
			I hope I was able to give you an idea about what my motivation is and who I am as a person.
